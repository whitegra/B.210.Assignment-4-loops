Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to compute LCM/GCF OR to scan a passage > 200 characters to count the number of times a specfic character is found in the passage.


Inputs:
- num_1
- num_2
- run_again
- passage
- character
  
Expected Output:
- should return LCM/GCF
- should return number of times the character is in the passage
- should prompt user to enter new passage / character if the passage is < 200 characters OR if the character is not in the passage (was too lazy to type all that so hopefully it works)
- should prompt the user to re-enter a number if it is less than 0 [-]
  
Types of execution:

Repeated execution: For and while loops to repeat parts of the program if desired.
Sequential execution: User-defined functions are to execute from top to bottom.
Conditional execution: If else and while loops to determine if the program re-executes.
Reusable: User-defined functions may be reused inside or outside of the program.

Possible Improvements:
- Maybe incude more robust options (ex. letting the user make two calculations at once)
- Myabe include the passage names so the user can just recall the passage from its title
- Could be organized a bit better structurally and comments could be more organized
